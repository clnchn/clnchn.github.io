# Projects 
Here are some of the projects that I have worked on during my school terms and personal time. I have some new project ideas in mind that I would like to try out in the future. 

## Previous Projects
1. MarbleKombat
2. Search and Rescue Robot 

## New Project Ideas
1. Make my own citation tool
    - a lot of the inline citation tools needs subscription, I would like to build my own
2. Building management App 
    - a lot of student housing and condominums are purchased by investors and lived by renters. The landlords are usually not in touch with the conditions of their buildings, and many landlords own more than one house. Tenants do not have enough rights when concerns are brought up, and usually management team are only voted by landlords. 
    - I want to develop an app that can help to better organize the management system of a building instead of using emails as the main form of contact between building management, tenants and landlords. 
    - Landlords can better manage their rental units and be more involved in management process in a centralized system. 
    - No real building websites. 
    - This is just a concept build for me to build some application skills 
    
    -The following are the sections involved: 
- Concierge 
    - Package arrival, uber eat, things getting picked up
    - lobby, elevators, and amenities
    - Events
    - elect a Board of Directors participationâ€™s
