## About Me
I am software engineer. My name is Celene, a Computer Engineering Master student at University of Toronto. I finished my undergrad at University of Waterloo in Mechatronics Engineering. This page is a side project for me to learn some web devlepment and showcast some of my old projects. I will occassionally add new features to this page as I continue to learn, stay tuned!



## What I do 
Engineer working on latest technology. Cloud Engineer, Data Engineer, Machine Leanrning Engineer 

My background is in mechatronics and embedded system, and I am interested in learning to build effective system design and focus on the future. Currently I am exploring more aspects of software engineering to have the tools to take advantage of the next economic shift, including cloud computing, distributed system and machine learning. Outside of school and work, I like discovering new genres of music and sports with my friends. My current hobbies includes playing badminton and trying out new recipes during my spare time. My favourite badminton player is Lee Chong Wei. This year, I am also trying to pick up snowboarding.


Designer: 
Embedded Engineer: 
I have over 2 years of professional experience working for Embedded Systems. I love the aspect of combining hardware and software systems together. 

Machine Learning: 
As I work towards my graduate degree, I have completed several projects on machine learning and deep neural networks on various topics. I aim to work towards the c

During my years studying Computer Science at University of Waterloo, I did multiple internships as a software engineer. I have working experience in full stack engineering (React, Flask, Django, NodeJS), cloud infrastructure (AWS, GCS) and Container Microservices (Docker, Kubernetes). I am currently studying network security and planning on taking EHC (Ethical Hacker Certification) later this year.



Celene performed an incredible job for this work term and exceeded all expectations. She was given a difficult research project to develop an image capturing application on a FPGA board which required her to work independently with minimal guidance and was able to build a solid foundation that can be used by future co-op students to continue on. Celine was also very detail oriented and resourceful, allowing her to resolve many challenges she faced independently. She also showed initiative and interest by occassioanly requesting other work outside of the scope of her job to allow her to gain more knowledge and experience. Once you have graduated, feel free to contact us if you wish to return, we would be happy to have you join the team! Thank you for the great work term Celene, best of luck in the future!

It is such a pleasure to have Hsuan Chen as our engineering Co-Op student for the past four month. She fully demonstrates her strong background knowledge and learning abilities to everyone in the department, which is very impressive. Her excellent work on the automation of our current program greatly helped to improve the efficiency and quality. I would highly recommend her to any future academic and professional opportunities.

Hsuan Chen shows an ability to learn and fit in the new working environment rapidly. She exceeds the production expectations and continues to collaborate with other team members, which helped the whole team to keep achieving schedule and budget goals. Her creativities and enthusiasms in programming contribute to finish projects in a timely manner. The knowledge she gained for Reliability/Mechanical Engineering and software applications is a great asset to the company.

## ‚ö°Quick Start

1. Install Flowise
    ```bash
    npm install -g flowise
    ```
2. Start Flowise

    ```bash
    npx flowise start
    ```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

## üê≥ Docker

1. Go to `docker` folder at the root of the project
2. Create `.env` file and specify the `PORT` (refer to `.env.example`)
3. `docker-compose up -d`
4. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
5. You can bring the containers down by `docker-compose stop`

## üë®‚Äçüíª Developers

Flowise has 3 different modules in a single mono repository.

-   `server`: Node backend to serve API logics
-   `ui`: React frontend
-   `components`: Langchain components

### Prerequisite

-   Install Yarn
    ```bash
    npm i -g yarn
    ```

### Setup

1. Clone the repository

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/FlowiseAI/Flowise.git
    ```

2. Go into repository folder

    ```bash
    cd Flowise
    ```

3. Install all dependencies of all modules:

    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

4. Build all the code:

    ```bash
    yarn build
    ```

5. Start the app:

    ```bash
    yarn start
    ```

    You can now access the app on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)

6. For development build:

    ```bash
    yarn dev
    ```

    Any code changes will reload the app automatically on [http://localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080)

## üîí Authentication

To enable app level authentication, add `USERNAME` and `PASSWORD` to the `.env` file in `packages/server`:

```
USERNAME=user
PASSWORD=1234
```
