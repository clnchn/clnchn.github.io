Hello! I am Celene. I am currently a Computer Engineering student at the University of Toronto after finishing my Mechatronics degree at the University of Waterloo. I enjoy coding, and I specialize in embedded engineering computer visualization engineering and network engineering; I love to learn & apply algorithms to real life problems.

Through my years of study, I interned at various software companies and finance companies. One of my favourite internship is working at DMG: there I developed a graph algorithm called walletscore, which is used to evaluate the riskness of a bitcoin wallet. The product is shipped to production, and it's live here https://dmgblockchain.com/blockseer

I enjoyed finance as much as I enjoyed coding, and I am currently working on a pet project to divide market state as Markov Chain in order to predict future performance.

During my years studying Mechatronics Engineering at University of Waterloo, I did multiple internships as a software engineer. I have working experience in Embedded C++. I am currently studying network security and planning on taking EHC (Ethical Hacker Certification) later this year.

For my career, I see myself working in a technology related field. I currently have no particular preference for the type of company, but I hope my future co-op placements will help me decide.

Aside from work, I am also a hardcore metal guitarist, an avid community volunteer and a wannabe junior boxer. My current hobbies include discovering new genres of music, building applications, learning how to cook and paint during my spare time. 

My current hobbies include discovering new genres of music and building applications, an avid community volunteer and a wannabe Kpop dancer. In the upcoming years, I have plans involving learning new languages and picking up other skills such as oil painting to name a few. I am also interested in the startup scene!


Recently I am picking up on trying to contribute to Open Source projects to improve my programming and debugging skills. 

Fun fact to know about me: I‚Äôve had many recurring dreams before

Ultimate Automated Trading System - a highly-adaptive, scalable and self-regulating system requiring no manual intervention.




Currently, I am interested in exploring different fields in software and programming. My previous field and focus was mostly in embedded system and real time operating systems. Now I have been looking into cloud computing, computer vision, machine learning. 
Outside of school, I like to travel, learn about history and travel. I also practice my violin and draw and design RV stickers. Currently I‚Äôm trying some new recipes and learning snowboard 




Computer Science is the study of computers and computing through the understanding of algorithms, information theory and data analysis, automation and computing theory. Computer scientists learn programming languages, software development, and computing architecture, which is the design and structure of a computer.

Computer Engineers are the ones who test and create the motherboard, the chipset, the RAM memory and so on. They also develop the basic firmware that allows these components to interact with the operating system.

Computer Science deals with data and algorithms while Computer Engineering is focused on hardware and firmware.

Computer Engineers develop and test the hardware and firmware for many different devices and applications. Hardware means the physical part of a computer, including components like the graphics card, the motherboard, or the keyboard. Firmware is a type of software which handles low-level control of the device‚Äôs hardware. Low-level control means basic functions and an example of firmware is the BIOS in your computer. A TV remote control also works with firmware. By comparison high-level is complex software like an Operating System. Firmware enables software to function.
