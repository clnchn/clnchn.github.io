CNN

What is a Convolutional Neural Network?
A Convolutional Neural Network is a powerful neural network that uses filters to extract features from images. It also does so in such a way that position information of pixels is retained.
What do you mean by Convolution in a CNN?
A convolution is a mathematical operation applied on a matrix. This matrix is usually the image represented in the form of pixels/numbers. The convolution operation extracts the features from the image.

Why do we need to learn Convolutional Neural Networks?
Neural networks have led to huge breakthroughs in machine learning and are the fundamental reason behind the deep learning boom. Neural networks like CNNs have proved particularly successful in working with image data and ever since being used in ImageNet competition in 2012, they have been the frontrunners in research and industry while dealing with images.
How are Convolutional Neural Networks better than ANN?
While solving an image classification problem using ANN, the number of trainable parameters increases drastically with an increase in the size of the image. Convolutional Neural Networks captures the spatial features from an image, which ANNs fail to do so. 
How can I implement Convolutional Neural Networks?
Convolutional Neural Networks have become the go-to method for solving any image data challenge. All popular frameworks support Convolutional Neural Networks like Tensorflow-Keras and PyTorch. You can also write your own CNNs using only NumPy.

What challenges could I face while implementing Convolutional Neural Networks?
Though Convolutional Neural Networks are powerful models, there can still be some challenges while implementing them. These include:
* Taking up a lot of processing power
* Needing a large amount of data for training
* Being difficult to interpret since deep learning is still a developing and rapidly changing field
