I’m documenting my learning notes in this blog. Other than writing a ML blog, I’m leading Applied Research at OpenAI on the side.

This is the place where I want to record all my learnings and readings to save, share, apply and create to absorb the knowledge. Transfer learning to something that I will always know.
