I’m documenting my learning notes in this blog. Other than writing a ML blog, I’m leading Applied Research at OpenAI on the side.

This is the place where I want to record all my learnings and readings to save, share, apply and create to absorb the knowledge. Transfer learning to something that I will always know. 


Some Topics that I would like to Explore: 
- [ ] Networking hardware and protocol 
- [ ] C++ 
- [ ] CPU architecture 
- [ ] OS Internals 
- [ ] Some Python Learning 
- [ ] Trading Strategies/Quantative Modelling 
- [ ] Debugging Skills 
- [ ] CS Fundamentals 
- [ ] Low Level Architecture
- [ ] System/Processor Performance 
- [ ] Statistics/ probability
- [ ] Think out Loud for your reasoning and follow along with your solution 
- [ ] Engineering is all about trade-offs.
