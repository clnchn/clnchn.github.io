Computer Vision 

Using https://ai.stanford.edu/~syyeung/cvweb/index.html as a reading source, here are some of my notes. 

Computer vision is the science of teaching a computer how to interpret images. The goal is to bridge the gap between pixels on the screen and the meaning behind them. 

The historical roots of computer vision began in the 1950s and is closely intertwined with the study of human vision. To teach computers how to be able to "see," researchers have sought inspiration from visual perception in humans. For computers to emulate visual perception in humans, researchers must first understand how human vision works. Some of the first milestones started in the 1950s; they explored and gained deeper understandings of the inner workings of the human eye and then extended their findings to computer vision.


The timeline below for some important milestones in computer vision. 


16th Century: Camera Obscura (dark box with convex lens) 
1959: Hubel and Wiesel @ Sweden, sensory processing, idea for neural network


2009: IMAGENET, database
2012: ALEXNET
